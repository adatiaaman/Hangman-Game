HANGMAN Game

File 'Hangman.pl' in the directory.
To run the program and play the game, you need to run the command 'perl Hangman.pl' in the terminal.

The word consists of lower case english alphabets only.
If the user enters anything other than that then the program will prompt inavlid input.
Note: The list of words from which a random word is selected is taken same as given in the assignment.

You have to guess the hidden word.
To make a guess, enter a lower case english alphabet, otherwise it will be invalid.
If the alphabet has been already guessed before then the chance will not count and you will not lose a chance.
If the guess is valid, then the program will check if it is present in the word.
If present it will show that where at which position it is present.
If not present, then you will lose a chance (can also be made out by looking at the hangman displayed).
Total chances given: 6
You WIN, if you successfully guess the word in less than 6 (valid) wrong guesses.
You LOSE, if you are unable to guess the word and have made 6 wrong guesses.
